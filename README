MANTISSA
(Mathematical Algorithms for Numerical Tasks In Space System Applications)

This product is a low level library of mathematical algorithms that
can be useful in space systems developments. It includes for example a
small set of linear algebra classes that should be sufficient to
implements least squares methods, linear equations solving, some ODE
integrators, some polynomials and algebra-related classes and
direct-search optimization methods.

In order to build the mantissa package, you need the following tools  :

 - ant
   http://ant.apache.org

 - junit (only if you want to rerun the tests)
   http://www.junit.org

Building the package is done by the following command :

     ant

This should create a mantissa.jar file and a mantidoc.zip file

To install mantissa, you should put the mantissa.jar file somewhere in
your CLASSPATH. If you want to install the documentation, unpack the
mantidoc.zip file in a place where your Web server can find it and
put a link to mantidoc/index.html in your documentation tree.


If you want to run the tests you should do :

     ant test

If you want to run only a subset of the tests, you should set the
test.class property to the root of the subset like this :

     ant -Dtest.class=org.spaceroots.mantissa.ode.AllTests test
